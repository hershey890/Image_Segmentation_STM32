# Image Segmentation an STM32H7 Using UNet
Image segmentation on an STM32H7 STM32H7 microcontroller by implementing a UNet-inspired network.

The largest output of any layer is only 262 Kb and the board has 564 Kb of RAM. It runs inference at around 0.5-1 FPS by transfering images from PC to the MCU over USB.
